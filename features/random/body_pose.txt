sitting cross-legged with hands resting on knees
standing with one hand on hip and the other pointing forward
lying on stomach with chin propped up on both hands
kneeling with arms raised triumphantly above head
standing with both hands behind back in a formal pose
sitting with legs stretched out and leaning back on both hands
standing on one leg with the other leg bent at the knee
crouching down with both hands touching the ground
standing with arms folded across chest confidently
lying on side with head resting on bent arm
standing with one hand shielding eyes as if looking into distance
sitting with knees pulled up to chest and arms wrapped around legs
standing with both hands clasped behind head in relaxed pose
leaning against wall with one foot up and arms crossed
standing with one arm extended outward and palm facing up
