standing upright with arms at sides
sitting in chair with hands on lap
walking with natural arm swing
standing with hands in pockets
sitting with legs crossed at ankles
standing with slight lean to one side
sitting upright with hands resting on table
standing with weight shifted to one hip
sitting with one leg over the other
standing with arms loosely at sides
sitting forward with elbows on knees
standing with hands clasped in front
sitting back in chair with relaxed posture
standing with one hand holding the other wrist
sitting with both feet flat on floor
laying on back with arms at sides
laying on side with knees slightly bent
laying face down with head turned to side
laying on back with hands behind head
laying curled up in fetal position
standing with arms crossed over chest
standing with hands on hips
standing with one hand on hip
standing with arms folded behind back
standing with hands clasped behind head
standing with one arm raised overhead
standing in wide stance with feet apart
standing with arms stretched above head
standing with one foot slightly forward
standing with hands pressed together in front
sitting cross-legged on floor
sitting with legs stretched out straight
sitting hunched over with head in hands
sitting with arms wrapped around knees
sitting sideways in chair
